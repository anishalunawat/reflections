By viewing the difference you know what is the difference between correctly working file
and other file and hence you have a summary of possible mistaken areas, this quickens
your search and rectification process.

how optimise code ?
you can cross check your previous logic
undo the unwanted changes
easy glance of formulation of your code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: 
gain flexibility
only significant commit exists
no code that is not successfully running
cons:
may forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in
one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
To store dependencies that change due to changed file after previous commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log will show the purpose of commit and will help to recognise the change and id of
 the consecutive commit to see the modification using diff command between the two ids
 
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because u can get back easily to the correctly working previous version with git checkout yaeee
