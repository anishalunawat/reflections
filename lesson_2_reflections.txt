What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
creates a repository using current working directory we can create a git repository using init

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an area where we can choose to keep only those files which we want to keep in our present commit and keep
 logically different commits separate by committing only files in that area.
 
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By only adding files belonging to single logical change before commit to staging area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
while working on multiple features and functionalities simultaneously, on working multiple version of program
experimenting with various part of project

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps me to know well where the bifurcations are for fixing bugs or adding new functionalities,
also it creates a map of addition of various logical structure and which all can be combined.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
both the functionalities get merged into single project, to get clear understanding of how things get done :)

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
It will lead to introduction of bug or a version of project not expected by the user.
pros no manually digging into code and extra effort on finding the correct version of expected commit file required
